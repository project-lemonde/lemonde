# Project LeMonde: A Decentralized Web Space for Everyone

## For Developers

Welcome to Project LeMonde! This project aims to create an open, decentralized 3D space where everyone can engage in creative activities, interact with others, and share and own content.

**Development Approach:**
This project is designed for development by a small team (often a single developer) and relies heavily on AI agent support throughout all stages of the development processâ€”from design and implementation to testing and even runtime debugging. AI is not just a tool but a crucial partner in the development team.

**Core Technology Stack:**
*   **Programming Language:** TypeScript
*   **Frontend:** React
*   **3D Rendering:** Babylon.js
*   **Real-time Communication:** WebRTC
*   **Collaborative Editing:** CRDT (Yjs)
*   **Package Management:** pnpm
*   **Build Tool:** Vite

**Key Functional Requirements (AI-Related Excerpts):**
*   **FR-AI-DevSupport1-4:** AI agent support for code generation, refactoring suggestions, automated test generation, and documentation assistance.
*   **FR-AI-NPCDebug1-3:** AI agents participate as NPCs in multiplayer sessions to assist with testing and debugging.

## For End Users

Project LeMonde is a place where you can freely create 3D worlds, connect with friends and people from around the globe, and share new experiences.

**What You Can Do in Project LeMonde (Examples):**
*   **Collaborate in Real-Time:** Create games or produce artwork in a 3D space together with friends.
*   **Own and Share Content:** The ownership of avatars and items you create is protected by digital certificates, allowing for secure sharing and exchange.
*   **AI-Powered Support:** AI will support your creative activities. For instance, by simply describing what you want, AI might suggest or generate 3D objects for you. AI may also join games as NPCs (Non-Player Characters) to play with you or help you discover new ways to enjoy the space.
*   **An Open World:** Project LeMonde is developed as open source, allowing anyone to freely develop and connect their own clients or services.

We aim to build a platform where users can intuitively create content and interact with others, even without specialized knowledge in programming or 3D modeling.
